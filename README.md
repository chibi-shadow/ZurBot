# ZurBot

**A lil' bot for Plug.dj [WIP]**

okay this bot is in an early development stage you can not use it at the moment. 
BUT you can participate to the development:
	* you can translate the bot from English to any other language 
	* you can correct my English (cause it's not my mother tongue)
	* you can also help me to write functions for the bot BUT please contact me before, I'll answer if I need help

if you want to help to traduce the bot here is a tutorial with detailed description for all variables:
	
	| endInit | $var0 | the bot version |
	| ban | $var0 | the user who used the command |
	|  | $var1 | the banned user |
	|  | $var2 | the ban time |
	| kick | $var0 | the user who used the command |
	|  | $var1 | the kicked user |
	|  | $var2 | the kick time |
	| eta | $var0 | the user who used the command |
	|  | $var1 | the time |
